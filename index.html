        <h2>Curse of the Macbook Boys</h2>
        <p class ="begin-post"> The sun begins to set into the mountains behind this small town, the sounds of chirping birds echoing through the streets. A group of three odd characters exit the tavern with a look of determination. “So we’re really going to find him another fantasy Macbook huh?” says, one of the characters. A tall tiefling women with eyes the color of shining emerald , Hair tangled, wavy, and dark as obsidian that contrast her almost ghostly pale skin complexion. “Hmm I guess” the half orc murmurs in deep grunting voice. “Well you did break it in the first place!’ A human paladin responds.</p>

        <h4>**SPOILERS FOR CURSE OF STRAHD**</h4>
