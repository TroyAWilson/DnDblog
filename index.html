        <h2>Curse of the Macbook Boys</h2>
          <h3>A Prologue</h3>
        <p class ="begin-post"> The sun begins to set into the mountains behind this small town, the sounds of chirping birds echoing through the streets. A group of three odd characters exit the tavern with a look of determination. “So we’re really going to find him another fantasy Macbook huh?” says, one of the characters. A tall tiefling women with eyes the color of shining emerald , Hair tangled, wavy, and dark as obsidian that contrast her almost ghostly pale skin complexion. “Hmm I guess” the half orc murmurs in deep grunting voice. “Well you did break it in the first place!’ A human paladin responds.</p>
          <p>After traveling the day, they spark up a fire and pitch their tents to rest for the night. As they talk over this mysterious flyer that all brought them together to the same tavern. Gonnar take notice to the fog surrounding their campsite. A thick white fog creeps closer surrounding the camp on all sides and eventually consuming the camp entirely. Gonnar reaches through the fog grabbing hold of Nemeia and Mike pulling them closer. As they stand huddled together they’re overcome with the feeling of falling, as if their world had just been flipped over entirely. They gasp for breathes and heave with nausea from this intense feeling as the fog disperses, it seems the trees have lost their leaves as the branches twist and contort in an unsettling fashion. </p>
          <p>“Well I guess we should probably see what’s going on, we’re clearly not in the same forest”</p>
