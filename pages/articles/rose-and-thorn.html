            <h2>Rose & Thorn</h2>
          <p class ="begin-post"> “Well I guess we should probably see what’s going on, we’re clearly not in the same
            forest”  says the paladin. They make their way toward what they believe to be north. Eventually they come across a road made of dirt and gravel leads to a village, its tall houses dark as tombstones. Nestled among these solemn dwellings are a handful of closed-up shops.
	          A soft whimpering draws their eye toward a pair of children standing in the middle of an otherwise lifeless street. A young boy and an older girl, about seven and ten respectively, pale in skin tone but dressed in elegant purples and reds. The boy has, grasped tightly in his hands, a small doll.
	          After shushing the boy, the girl  turns and says “There’s a monster in our house!” She points to a tall brick row house that has seen better days. Its has a gated portcullis on the ground floor and a rusty gate hangs slightly ajar. The house on either side are boarded up and look to be abandoned.
	          Nemeia leans over and says in a hushed tone to Gonar, “I like the tall one, can I make her my slave?”
	          “Maybe we should find out about this monster first.” Gonar responds followed by a swift sigh of disappointment by Nemeia.
	           Mike approaches and asks the kids,“So what’s the deal with this monster?” The small boy responds in a cracked and unconfident tone, “H-he lives in the basement and we can hear
             him, it sounds like this-” Thorn recreates a sound somewhere between a screaming roar and a pained groaning. They look at eachother with looks of skepticism. “Gonnar doesn’t care!” as he tries to pick up Thorn. Grasping for the boy, his hands push through him as Thorn’s form twists and turns into fog. Roses body also dissipates into fog which now surrounds the players inching closer forcing them into the house or be consumed by the fog

               A wrought-iron gate with hinges on one side and a lock on the other fills the archway of a stone portico.
               Hanging on the south wall of the foyer is a shield emblazoned with a stylized golden windmill on a red field, flanked by framed portraits of stony-faced aristocrats(Long dead members of the Durst family). Mahogany-framed  double doors set with panes of stained glass lead inside the house.
               A wide hall runs the width of the house, with a black marble fireplace at one end and a sweeping, red marble staircase at the other. Mounted on the wall above the fireplace is a longsword with a windmill cameo worked into the hilt. The wood-paneled walls are are ornately sculpted with images of vines, flowers, nymphs, and satyrs.The decorative paneling follows the staircase as it circles upward to the second floor
               A cloakroom has several black cloaks hanging from hooks on the walls. A top hat sits on a high shelf
               This oak-paneled room looks like a hunter’s den. Mounted above the fireplace is a stag’s head, and positioned around the outskirts of the room are three stuffed wolves. Two padded chairs draped in animal furs face the hearth, with an oak table between them supporting a large cask(containing wine), Two carved wooden goblets, a pipe rack, and a candelabrum. A chandelier hangs above a cloth covered table surrounded by four chairs. Two cabinets stand against the walls. The east cabinet sports a large hanging lock
               The kitchen is tidy, with dishware, cookware, and utensils neatly placed on shelves. A worktable has a cutting board and rolling pin a top it. A stone, dome-shaped oven stands near the east wall, its bent iron stovepipe connecting to a hole in the ceiling. Behind the stove and to the left is a thin door leading to a well-stocked pantry
               The centerpiece of this wood-paneled dining room is a carved mahogany table surrounded by eight high-backed chairs with sculpted armrests and cushioned seats. A crystal chandelier hangs above the table, which is covered with resplendent silverware and crystalware polished to a dazzling shine. Mounted above the marble fireplace is a mahogany-framed painting of an alpine vale.The wall paneling is carved with elegant images of deer amongst the trees. DC 12 perception check characters see twisted faces carved into the tree trunks and wolves lurking amid the carved foliage. Red silk drapes cover the windows, and a tapestry depicting hunting dogs and horse-mounted aristocrats chasing after a wolf hangs from an iron rod bolted to the south wall.
