            <h2>Let's Talk About Hags</h2>
          <p class ="begin-post">
            So, I just finished prepping the Old Bonegrinder encounter for my party to play on Tuesday and now I’m preparing the eulogies for their funerals because HOLY GOOD LORD LATHANDER this is one difficult encounter!
          </p>
          <h4>**SPOILERS FOR CURSE OF STRAHD**</h4>
             <p class="indent">
               For those of you who have no idea, Old Bonegrinder is a windmill in the Curse of Strahd adventure and a fairly early one at that, right out of the first town. This encounter uses NIGHT HAGS! Out of the three hags available in the monster manual these are the strongest of all the variants with 17 AC and over 100HP. This is without considering their innate spellcasting (magic missile at will!), their claws that have +7  to hit and do a minimum of 6 damage(My warlock has a total of about 25 hp), and their abilities to ability to enter the Ethereal Plane if they’re ever in any form of danger.
             </p>
             <p class="indent">
               This encounter has not one, not two, but THREE NIGHT HAGS! There’s an optional minion esque enemies that they can summon but there’s honestly no need. I imagine this encounter isn’t one that’s supposed to taken full force, guns blazing. It’s supposed to be talked through  because these hags aren’t here to kill the party they’re here to sell pastries and make deals. So it’s possible and even preferred that the party avoids this fight at all costs, get what they need from the windmill and get out of there!
            </p>
             <p class="indent">
               At least that would be the prefered option if your party hadn’t taken the time in between breaking cups at the tavern and letting vampire spawn loose onto the town to bully an old women in the street. This old women was the hags coven leader and mother in disguise, my party attacked her and stole her cart of pastries making an enemy of this very powerful coven of hags!
             </p>
             <p class="indent">
               All in all though hags are one of my favorite enemies in Dungeons and Dragons, I love the mystery of children going missing and the shock that players have when they realize that this old lady is taking and eating them. On top of that enemies will spellcasting and the ability to run away and become recurring enemies is something I love!
